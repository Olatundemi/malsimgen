This modified version of malsimgem helps to generate simulated runs with the inclusion of prevalance data in ages 2-10

The modifications made were primarily in odin model, equilibrium function and parameter list (all from mamasante) but sourced to simulation generation package, 

## Note

generate_simulation_script.R was added to detail simulation parameters (and arguments)
