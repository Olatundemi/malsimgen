<!-- badges: end -->

This modified version of malsimgem helps to generate simulated runs with the inclusion of prevelance data in ages 2-10

The modifications made were primarily in odin model, equilibrium function and parameter list (all in mamasante) but sourced to simulation genaration package, 

## Example

generate_simulation_script.R was added to detail simulation parameters (and arguments)
